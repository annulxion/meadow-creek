We all want to wear our best and be presentable when we go out in public, but I especially want to wear my best to church.  What we wear on the outside can (and often does) reflect what's on the inside.  I am going to church with the intent of worshipping my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and I want that to show.  If the politicians, the businessmen, the lawyers, and the sports commentators of this world take the time and care to look like they care about what they're doing and taking part in, then shouldn't we?

But what is our best?  Something that costs a lot of money?  Something formal, or culturally acceptable?  Suits, ties, dresses, nice shoes, earrings, and sometimes hats have long been a tradition for formal dress in this country, and indeed, most of the world.  However, I find in 1 Timothy 2:9-10, the apostle Paul warns against "gold, or pearls, or costly array" and supports the wearing of "modest apparel," and even of "good works," as though it were a garment.  The word "modest" is used to imply decency, of course, but also as a counterpoint to the word "costly."  Paul makes the point that ordinary clothes and a reputation for good works is to be desired in worship over drawing attention to our physical appearance or status, whether it be beauty or the display of wealth. 

Now, I've heard an argument made against distributing and wearing t-shirts at church-hosted events, and that it is akin to wearing a uniform, and in essence, being "conformed to the world," as Paul warned against in Romans 12:2.  Yet we consider suits and ties and dresses (the uniform of the corporate world and of high society, culturally acceptable according to the "traditions of men") as not just appropriate for worship, but the gold standard.  I believe the most important thing about what we wear to church (or anywhere for that matter, since presenting our bodies as a living sacrifice and not being conformed to the world are not just things that should happen on a Sunday morning) is that it should not draw attention to ourselves.  Our motive should be to please God.  Is he looking for the hairdos, the jewelry, and the nice clothes?  Or is it something incorruptible that He has given us? - "the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price." - 1 Peter 3:4

What is your best?  Are you wearing it to church?
