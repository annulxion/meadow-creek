1. We Believe in the existence, immutability, omnipotence, omniscience,
omnipresence, and eternal perfections of the one and only true and living God,
who exists in the three fold, yet undivided and indivisible substance of the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, who was and is the sovereign Creator,
Upholder, Governor and Judge of the Universe. (I John 5:7, John 1:1, John 10:30, John 17:3)

2. We Believe that the 1611 King James Version of the Old and New Testament
Scriptures are the perfectly inspired Word of God, and the only infallible rule,
or standard, of faith and practice; and that, as such, the Bible teaches all that
we ought to know, believe, or practice religiously. (II Timothy 3:16, II Peter 1:21, Hebrews 1:1-3)

3. We believe in the doctrine of total depravity – that is, the entire human family
are justly condemned, all having sinned in Adam; and that our life received by
virtue of the natural birth is poisoned with sin; and that in nature the man is
sinful in all his parts, and all are dead in trespasses and in sins. (Romans 5:12, Romans 7:14, Romans 8:7, John 6:44, Ephesians 2:1)

4. We believe in the eternal and personal and unconditional election of the saints
unto glory; that they were chosen in Christ by the Father before the world was
– before they had any actual existence; that God predestinated them unto the
adoption of sons, and that they should be conformed to the image of His Son;
and they will all be finally and ultimately saved in glory. But we do solemnly
deny that God predestinated sin. He has determined to overrule and punish
sin. Those whom God has not, or did not, predestinate to be conformed to the
image of his Son are left to act in their own sins to their just condemnation, to
the praise of God’s glorious justice.(Psalms 33:12, Ephesians 1:4, I Peter 1:2, I Thessalonians 1:4, I Corinthians 1:30, Romans 9:11, Ephesians 1:5, Romans 8:29)

 

5. We believe that the atonement and the redemption by Jesus Christ are for the
elect only, and that they are justified in the sight of God by the imputed
righteousness of the Son alone. (John 10:15, Acts 20:28, Romans 5:11,
Matthew 1:21, Romans 10:4, II Corinthians 5:21, Galatians 2:21, Romans 8:33)

6. We believe in the direct, immediate, sovereign, irresistible, and, in all cases,
the effectual work of the Holy Spirit in calling, regenerating, and sanctifying the
elect of God, and that in His own time and way. The work of regeneration is an
instantaneous and internal work, and is accomplished by the work of the spirit
of God on the spirit of the sinner. (John 6:37, Titus 3:5, II Timothy 1:9, John 10:27-28)

7. We believe in the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead – that is, that the
bodies of all who die will be raised at the final windup and consummation of all
things. We mean by this that it is the body that dies, and it is the same body
which dies that shall be raised from the dead. The bodies of the saints will, at
the resurrection, be changed, made spiritual, immortal and reunited with their
souls, and taken into the glorious presence of the Lord, and their happiness
will be unending. The others will be cast into eternal torment, and their
punishment will be unending. (John 5:28-29, I Thessalonians 4:13-17, I Corinthians 15:42-57, Acts 24:15, Matthew 25:46)

8. We believe that baptism and the Lord’s Supper are ordinances of Jesus Christ,
and that true believers (those who have been born again) are the only proper
subjects for baptism, and Scriptural baptism is a burial in water; that the
ordinances of the church are in the hands of the church for keeping; and that
baptism is not valid unless administered by one authorized by a gospel church
to administer the ordinances. Unleavened bread and wine (grape wine) are to
be used in the Lord’s Supper. We believe that we should engage in washing
each other’s feet, following the example of the Master, as He said, “I have
given you an example.” (Matthew 3:13-17, Mark 16:16, Acts 8:37-38, I Peter 3:20-21, I Corinthians 11:23-26, Luke 22:7-20, John 13:1-17, I Timothy 5:10)

9. We believe that baptism is the first ordinance, and that no one has a right to
the Lord’s Supper unless he has first been baptized by the proper authority,
and is in order with his brethren at home. (Acts 2:41, You must be baptized
into the fellowship of the church to be a member.)

10. We believe that the Lord’s children (those who have been born again) are
under parental law to the blessed Lord, and that He has promised blessings in
His Word to His children who obey him, which He has not promised to others,
and that these blessings thus promised cannot be attained to or enjoyed any
other way only by obeying Him– doing the things commanded by Him. On the
other hand, He has promised chastisement – suffering, sorrow, trouble, and
distress – upon their rebellion and disobedience. (Ephesians 2:10, James 2:18, Hebrews 11:6, Matthew 7:7, John 14:15, Matthew 6:33, Hebrews 12:6-11)

11. We believe that a gospel church is a body of baptized believers, who have
banded themselves together to keep house for the Lord, and who maintain the
true principles of doctrine and practice as laid down in the New Testament. Yet
a true church may err from the right way; and when they do so, the Scriptural
injunction is for them to repent. The church was set up by the Saviour during
His personal ministry on earth, and this church has an unbroken succession
unto the present day, and it will remain on earth some place until our Lord’s
second personal coming. The Lord established His Kingdom, or church, for a
home for His little children. He gave all the laws and rules and regulations to
govern in this kingdom. We have no right to make new laws, laws not found in
His book; nor do we have a right to disobey the laws which He gave. (I Corinthians 1:2, Titus 2:1, I Timothy 4:16, Revelation 3:14-22, Matthew 16:18-19, II Timothy 4:1-5, Jude 1:3, Revelation 22:18-19.)

12. We believe the institution of marriage was designed by God in the beginning of
the creation and the pattern He gave was for one man to be joined to one
woman in marriage. This pattern was recognized and confirmed by Jesus
Christ in the New Testament. We as a New Testament Church, recognize
this as the only acceptable pattern for marriage. (Gen. 2:18,23,24; Matt. 19:4-5)
