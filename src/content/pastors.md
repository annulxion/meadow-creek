Think about this.

Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.

The Apostle Paul wrote to the Ephesians, 6:10, finally - meaning hereafter, for the future, henceforth, from this point onward—finally my brethren be strong.  Just as Paul wrote to the Ephesians he writes to us.  To be strong. To be strengthened.  Have might. 

The world at this point in time seems to be very weak, don’t you think? It’s because it is weak. We are weak.  Not knowing exactly what to do, how to act, how to cure this virus and sickness.  Paul didn’t just say be strong he said, wrote, be strong in the Lord.   The Lord is not at a loss.  The Lord is not like we are - - we’re not knowing, he is all knowing.  We are without wisdom, the Lord is wisdom.  The Lord is just as sovereign right now as He has ever been.  Let us not even for a moment lose sight of where our joy is founded, where our comfort lies, where our true happiness is and will ever be.  It’s in the Lord, and he still is the Lord.  When we are strong in the Lord, we are strong.

Paul also wrote Philippians 3:1, finally - - from this point onward, finally my brethren rejoice in the Lord.  Oh yes, even now we can rejoice if we think about the Lord.  But even better than just thinking about the Lord, Paul writes REJOICE in the Lord.  We should be in a constant state of joy, and when we are, we are strong in the Lord.

Can you believe that there is an eternal reservation with your name on it being kept by the power of God in an eternal heaven? You say, I hope so, well me too... we hope by the power of God.   Oh my, one day all the Lord’s people will be together virus free, sin free, all gathered together round the throne.  Finally my brethren rejoice!  

And at Philippians 4:8 Paul writes finally, brethren—- from this point onward, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.  Whew, that’s a lot of whatsovers!  What is true?  What is honest?  What is pure? What is lovely?  What is of good report?  God’s word is true.  God’s grace is lovely.  God is always good to think on because God is always good.  How miserable we would constantly be without knowing the goodness of God.  We are always His and he is always ours.

Knowing that His eye is always on the sparrow, and I know he watches me...

I sing because I’m happy, I sing because I’m free, for his eye is on the sparrow, and I know he watches me.

Oh my, the Lord is always watching over us, always.  Sister Civilla D. Martin knew it, didn’t she, when she wrote these words?



Finally, my brethren...

Now that’s a stimulus package!

In hope,

Brother Eddie
