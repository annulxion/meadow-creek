We the Meadow Creek Baptist Church of Christ enter into the following Covenant holding believers baptism by immersion, particular election of God in Christ, effectual calling by the Holy Ghost, free justification through the imputed righteousness of Christ, progressive sanctification through Godâ€™s grace and truth delivered in the Scriptures, in the Old and New Testament which we believe do contain perfect rules for Faith and Practice; final perseverance or continuance of the saints in grace; the Resurrection of our bodies after death at the day which God hath appointed to judge the quick and dead; and life Everlasting.   Amen.
